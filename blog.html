                        On March 27, 2015 I backed my first Kickstarter which was the Jide Remix.  The Jide Remix a tablet-laptop hybrid which was develped by three ex-Googlers.  In order for the product to gain traction in the United States, they decided to launch a kickstarter where backers who pledged $39 and above got a free Remix to beta test on.

                        Specswise, the Remix comes with a Nvdeia 4+ processor, along with 2GB memory and 64GB internal storage.  However the main attraction of the Remix is not the hardware but the software instead.  The Jide Remix runs its own Remix OS built on top of Android Jellybean and is designed for productivity.  It gives the user the option to run more than one program in the same window and even has a filesystem which makes it easier for users to keep track of their files.

                        On April 27, when the Kickstarter ends, Jide will start shipping the Remix to us.  I believe the Jide Remix is a gamechanger and if implemented properly will be the perfect balance between productivity and convenience.  I am both excited and honored to beta test this product.
