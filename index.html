                Hello, my name is Immanuel Amirtharaj, but I'm usually known as Manny.  I am a sophomore at Santa Clara University studying Computer Science and Engineering.  Currently I have taken classes like Data Structures and Embedded Systems and have an extensive knowledge of C, C++, and Assembly.  In my spare time, I like to read, play cricket, and learn new things like web and mobile development.  Resume and contact information attatched as well.
